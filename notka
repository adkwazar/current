In the Middle Ages, medicine was deeply rooted in Hippocratic and Galenic theories. Practices were based on balancing the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile). This persisted throughout the period. Around 1000, medical treatments involved practices such as bloodletting, herbal remedies, and prayers. Physicians often sought to restore balance among the humors to promote health. By 1200, surgery during this era was limited to basic procedures, with a lack of understanding of anatomy. Medical knowledge was often intertwined with religious beliefs, and the healing process involved a spiritual dimension. As we approach 1400, hygiene was generally overlooked, contributing to the spread of diseases. Physicians and barber-surgeons played central roles in healthcare, employing various methods despite limited scientific understanding. Despite the limitations of medieval medicine, it laid the groundwork for future developments, blending ancient traditions with emerging knowledge.
